## THE BACK STORY...

 "Hey, you're (hiccup)...  Kyrr... err...  Kyrr... err... raan... nan.. aah..
 ummm...  (hiccup)... the one with all those funky temples and stuff...", you
 barely mumble, your head pounding and your vision somewhat blurred.

 "Kyrannalussi, Goddess of Peyennuu, Lady of Virtues, Defender of Dreams, Queen
 of Fantasy, The Eternal Pegasus, Keeper of Legends and Lore, The Grand
 Enchantress, Guide of Souls, Ruler of Hearts, Figment of Imagination, Chief
 Accountant of Olympus, Surgeon General, Jedi Master, Secretary of State, Zen
 Master Ninja, Bachelor of Science: Comp.  Science major, from Harvard, Maytag
 Repair Woman, and author of MY LIFE AS A GODDESS, to you Mr. User!"

 For some unknown reason you find this quite funny and start to giggle to
 yourself.  With great inebriated enthusiasm, you reply, "(hiccup) Oh..."

 She frowns at you, not amused.  "You drank one too many potions, became
 completely drunk, cursed out several of my clerics, and tried to have sexual
 intercourse with a bar stool -- you're an utter disgrace to the realm of
 fantasy!  You should be banished to reality for your horrendous misbehavior.
 However, hmmm, I believe I've got a more appropriate fate to serve as your
 punishment... and also teach you a few things, you mortal fool."

 Something about her tone of voice fills you with a foreboding feeling of
 impending doom, but nonetheless your "high" sense of humor just can't resist
 the smart-aleck reply, "It must be that time of the month for you, huh?"  You
 grin -- not a particularly wise choice of actions.

 "Why you, audacious fool!", she bellows -- in a rather deep voice for a Lady
 of Virtue.  "Alright, you think you're so smart?  Well, you're going to need
 all your wit and 'humor' to survive the sentence I'm going to give you!  You
 are doomed to forever walk the land of Peyennuu until you find the truth of
 life within yourself!"

 "Hmmm...  (hiccup).  How about what's behind curtain number two instead?".

 "An eternity of fire and brimstone, your flesh painfully rotting away, maggots
 and snakes crawling through your body, and icepicks being shoved under your
 toenails."  She smiles at you sweetly.

 After a moment's thought, you reply, "I'll think I'll take that quest to find
 the truth of life instead..."
 
## WHAT IS ALCHEMY II: THE HANGOVER?

 ALCHEMY II takes place in the swords-and-sorcery fantasy world of Peyennuu,
 the mythical land which was the setting for QUEST FOR MAGIC and QUEST OF THE
 ALCHEMISTS, two previous Major BBS/Worldgroup multi-user games.  However,
 unlike its predecessors, ALCHEMY II is much more of a satirical comedy than a
 "serious" quest.  Although not a "simple" game, by all means, it should be
 taken quite lightheartedly and with a sense of humor... as you search for the
 "truth of life".

## GAMEPLAY
 
 ALCHEMY II is an on-line RPG (Role-Playing Game), where you, and up to 255
 other users, can take on the "role" of an imaginary character within the
 context of the fantasy world of ALCHEMY II.  It is similiar in nature to the
 popular TSR, Inc. game of "Dungeons & Dragons", except the computer acts as an
 "automated Dungeon Master".  Game play is similiar to that of Zork, or any
 other text adventure, but with a key difference -- many people can
 simultaneously be interacting, in real-time, in the same simulated universe.

## INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
 
 Simply unzip the archive to your BBS server directory, add it to your menu,
 configure the MSG file to your liking, and start the BBS! It's that easy!

 Alchemy II: The Hangover has four MSG files and two special files that control
 the locations and object information. You can customize the world and objects
 a bit, although special rooms are programmed into the game. The level 3
 configuration is in ELWALC2M.MSG, and allows you to define a key required
 to play the game. Most everything else is a text block!
 
## MODULE HISTORY
 
 Alchemy II: The Hangover was one of a series of 7 text-based adventure RPGs
 written by Scott Brinker. It was the direct sequel to Quest of the Alchemists
 and set in the same world as Quest for Magic. Alchemy II was written in
 February 1989. It was sold by Moonshae Telecomm (later called Galactic
 Innovations, and later acquired by Galacticomm). It did receive a port from
 version 5.x to 6.x by Galacticomm, but was not sold long after that.
 
 It was acquired by Elwynor Technologies in 2005, and ported to Worldgroup 3.2
 in 2006, with a final release in 2021 after some bugs were fixed. In 2024, 
 the game was ported to The Major BBS V10.

## COMPILATION

 This is a Worldgroup 3.2 / Major BBS v10 module. It's compiled using Borland
 C/C++ 5.0 for Worldgroup 3.2. If you have a working Worldgroup 3.2 development
 kit, a simple "make -f ELWALC2" should do it! For Major BBS v10, import this
 project folder in the isv/ subtree of Visual Studio 2022, right click the
 project name and choose build! When ready to build for "release", ensure you
 are building for release.

## PACKING UP

 The DIST folder includes all of the items that should be packaged up in a 
 ELWALC2.ZIP. When unzipped in a Worldgroup 3.2 or Major BBS V10 installation 
 folder, it "installs" the module.
