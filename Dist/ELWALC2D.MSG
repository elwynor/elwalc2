   "Hey, you're (hiccup)... Kyrr... err... Kyrr... err... raan... nan.. aah..
ummm... (hiccup)... the one with all those funky temples and stuff...", you

   For some unknown reason you find this quite funny and start to giggle to
yourself.  With great inebriated enthusiasm, you reply, "(hiccup) Oh..."

   She frowns at you, not amused.  "You drank one too many potions, became
completely drunk, cursed out several of my clerics, and tried to have sexual
intercourse with a bar stool -- you're an utter disgrace to the realm of
fantasy!  You should be banished to reality for your horrendous misbehavior.
However, hmmm, I believe I've got a more appropriate fate to serve as your
punishment... and also teach you a few things, you mortal fool."

{   Something about her tone of voice fills you with a foreboding feeling of
impending doom, but nonetheless your "high" sense of humor just can't resist
the smart-aleck reply, "It must be that time of the month for you, huh?"
You grin -- not a particularly wise choice of actions.

   "Why you, audacious fool!", she bellows -- in a rather deep voice for a
Lady of Virtue.  "Alright, you think you're so smart?  Well, you're going to
need all your wit and 'humor' to survive the sentence I'm going to give you!
You are doomed to forever walk the land of Peyennuu until you find the truth
of life within yourself!"

   "Hmmm... (hiccup).  How about what's behind curtain number two instead?".

   "An eternity of fire and brimstone, your flesh painfully rotting away,
maggots and snakes crawling through your body, and icepicks being shoved
under your toenails."  She smiles at you sweetly.

   After a moment's thought, you reply, "I'll think I'll take that quest to
find the truth of life instead..."

Welcome to "ALCHEMY II: The Hangover", a comedy/fantasy adventure written
by Scott Brinker. It was designed and programmed in January-May 1989 and 
is copyrighted 2005-2024 by Elwynor Technologies with all rights reserved.  
If you try and infringe on any of that legal stuff, our lawyers will beat up 
your lawyers...

ALCHEMY II takes place in the swords-and-sorcery fantasy world of Peyennuu,
the mythical land which was the setting for QUEST FOR MAGIC and QUEST OF THE
ALCHEMISTS, two previous Major BBS/Worldgroup multi-user games.  However,
unlike its predecessors, ALCHEMY II is much more of a satirical comedy than
a "serious" quest.  Although not a "simple" game, by all means, it should
be taken quite lightheartedly and with a sense of humor... as you search for
the "truth of life".

The following screens of information will provide you with all the knowledge
you will require to successfully play ALCHEMY II, so please take your time
to read them carefully.  If you don't, we'll find you and have you shot...

INTROD
{ALCHEMY II is one of the most advanced games of its type, and therefore
requires a considerable amount of explanation, therefore please bear with
the following text.

ALCHEMY II is an on-line RPG (Role-Playing Game), where you, and up
to 255 other users, can take on the "role" of an imaginary character within
the context of the fantasy world of ALCHEMY II.  It is similiar in nature
to the popular TSR, Inc. game of "Dungeons & Dragons", except the computer
acts as an "automated Dungeon Master".  Game play is similiar to that of
Zork, or any other text adventure, but with a key difference -- many people
can simultaneously be interacting, in real-time, in the same simulated
universe.

If you need additional help in understanding the concept of game play, or
need help with commands, type "help" after you complete the introduction,
and a list of help options will be displayed for your convience.

Now, on to the specifics of ALCHEMY II... so whether you're new to these
multi-player worlds, or are a seasoned adventurer, the next couple screens
will be of importance to you.

     << Hit RETURN to continue >} T Alchemy II Text

INTROE
{Here's a little background...

ALCHEMY II takes place in the fantasy world of Peyennuu, land of the lovely
goddess Kyrannalussi.  Magic is a common aspect of daily life in Peyennuu,
and at this particular age in Peyennuuian history, the art of alchemy is
predominant.  Of course, for this adventure, HUMOR is also a common aspect
of Peyennuu...

Your character is an average, %s of Peyennuu.  Well, not THAT
average -- you were the type of young alchemist who liked to play with your
erection set, especially with the other kids.  (Did I mean to say "erector
set"?  Oh, sorry!).  Anyway, after a strange childhood, you went on to live
a stranger adulthood, experimenting with potion lore and fine wine (more of
the wine than the lore).  However, this tipsy lifestyle got you in some hot
water -- and not the Nude Saunas of Gringrin!  Finally, Kyrannalussi, the
head hocho of Peyennuuian deities, intervened and sentenced you to complete
a quest -- a quest for the truth of your life!  Now what the hell is that?
Hey, that's your job, not mine.  Anyway, you're not alone... many other
alchemists will be on the Kyrannalussi Sobriety Program too.  Misery loves
company (and so do pudendum parties)!

     << Hit RETURN to continue >} T Alchemy II Text

INTROF
{Okay, enough of the introduction, it's time to get on with it!  However,
before you start, you should be aware of a nice incentive to complete this
quest.  No, it's nothing of a sexual nature, I promise.  The first player
to find his/her truth of life on this system will be granted a prize! 
Seriously!  Instructions for collecting the prize will be presented upon 
completion of the quest... and remember -- only the FIRST player to solve 
the quest wins.

Again, if you need help with the commands, or anything of that nature, feel
free to type "help" and your questions shall be answered!

 ***

It has taken a long time to conceive this game and even a longer time to
gain the courage (insanity?) to actually go through with it.  Good luck,
and please forgive the horrendous attempts at humor to follow.  Thanks for
playing... this one's dedicated to you, its players.  Have fun...

In case if you need some help, here is a summary of some of the most-used
commands in the game, although there are others.  Also, for more information,
you will want to read "help potions" and "help npcs".

  n/s/e/w ........................... move in appropriate direction
  inv ............................... see what items you currently have
  gold .............................. see how much gold you have
  hits .............................. see how many hit points you have
  say <message> ..................... speak to other players
  whisper to <who> <message> ........ whisper to another player
  yell <message> .................... yell for others to hear
  drop <item in hand> ............... drop an item you are holding
  get <item> ........................ get an item lying around or nearby
  get <who>'s <item> ................ steal another player's item
  give <who> <item> ................. give another player an item
  look <something or someone> ....... look more closely at someone/something
  sit/lie/stand ..................... sit down, lie down, stand up
  kiss/hug/comfort <who or what> .... do nice things to other players/things
  kick/slap <who or what> ........... do mean things to other players/things

} T Alchemy II Text

HELPN {

One of the many neat new features of ALCHEMY II is the semi-intelligent,
computer-controlled characters of the game (for example, the bartender at
Avagadro's Tavern).  They have the ability to interact with the real players
by answering questions, acting as merchants and other roles, and offering
services and equipment -- for a price, most of the time.

The following command formats are suggested for most of the interaction with
these computer-controlled creatures (NonPlayerCharacters... NPCs):

     give <amount> gold to <npc>
     look <npc>
     ask <npc> <question>

In most cases these creatures cannot be harmed by the normal means used to
attack other players... their purpose is not to act as "random monsters".

However, you should beware of some NPC creatures, such as brownies, jazz
saxaphonists, killer squirrels, and others whom will harm your character
in one of many ways.

} T Alchemy II Text

HELPP {

Potions are the "heart" of this game, and success in the game lies with the
mastery of how they mix together and what effects they have when drunk,
shaken, thrown, or poured.  The following commands are most of the ones used
with potions:

     look <potion>
     mix <potion1> and <potion2>
     mix <potion1> and <potion2> and <potion3>
     drink <potion>
     shake <potion>
     pour <potion> on self

Sometimes, when you drink a potion, it will give you a special power... and
to use it you must perform another action, such as aiming your finger at
someone, or something like that.  An example is:

     aim finger at <who>

} T Alchemy II Text

HELPT {

Another "special" feature of ALCHEMY II is the fact that the world actually
comes alive around you.  The sun rises and sets, along with the two moons,
Amary and Ristina, creating both night and day enviroments.  Of course, this
also adds the factors of darkness and vision limitations, but we will leave
discovery of this up to you.

As days move by (4 Peyennuuian days to one real day in most cases), the
phases of the moons will change... and one hint is that this does have some
importance towards solving certain puzzles in the game.  The game also has
months and years, but again, we will let you discover the full extent of
this on your own.

When you exit the game, time continues to move on, although your player's
character is held is "suspended animation" until you return.

A2I023
{...This potion reminds you of the fruit punch you made in alchemy college,
which consisted of about 1%% fruit and 91%% a mixture of various alcoholic
substances and 8%% of Kyrannalussi knows what.  The odor that emanates from
it could probably kill a horse.

{...This potion makes your legs start to shake, and you lose your balance
and fall to the ground with a thump!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I024
{...This sweet-smelling, light-purple potion seems to be liquified lavander
roses.  For a moment, the smell sends you daydreaming into a fantasy world
of unicorns and pegasi, where true love is everywhere.  Ah, what rubbish --
the potion doesn't look nearly as appealing as a pint of fine wine would!

A2I024A

A2I026
{...As you closely examine this black and white potion, an image of a large
dog appears in your mind.  Ah, yes, the legend of Corvadam... you chuckle to
yourself at the thought of that strange marriage -- a man and his dog.  Oh,
well, you've seen worse wives...
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I026A
{...This potion tastes alot like wet dog, but you gulp it down anyway.
***
Your finger is suddenly filled with a magical urge to be aimed at someone!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I027
{...This potion looks like spaghetti sauce that a hostile, alein life force
(probably from Chicago) has infested.  The potion makes violent motions every
couple of minutes and emits loud, ominous growls... reminiscent of a certain
ex-lover.

Your finger is suddenly filled with an urge to be aimed at your spouse!

bowel trouble.

A2I030
{...This odorous potion reminds you of dragon's breath.  The smell brings
back memories of ancient folklore... of a legend where rubbing a dragon's
staff would make him come.  The wizards of old found this fascinating, but
you just think it's gross.  Anyway, the potion is a deep green with creamy
white splotches.

some friends!

blowing kisses at you everytime they rise to the surface.  As you examine it
closer, one of the bolder bubbles smooches you right on the lips and then
explodes in a shower of orange sparks!

{...As you drink this creamy potion, your mind suddenly explodes with cold
passion, and you burp loudly.

A2I035
{...Ah, the mystical, magical, special-formula, new, improved, formula-4B,
Mark VII, revised, improvised, and urinated Krelmmmm -- but best of all, it
contains the special ingrediant of Fraudulent!  Ah, ha!  You suddenly glance
around, looking for a psychotic python named Monty.

orifices at once!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I036
{...This light-brown potion seems to be emiting small clouds of white smoke,
emanating the distinct odor of burnt grass.  Strange sounds bubble from its
depths, and you hear the distinct mumuring of "frisk zarzecki snarbone...
FAZUUL! FAZUUL!".  You jump back from this unexpected exclamation, but the
potion seems to have mellowed out for a while.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I036A
{...As you drink this potion, you suddenly feel your insides twist in agony,
and suddenly spurt a "surprise" back into your hands...
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I037
{...Diet rootbeer is the closest comparison you can find for this foaming,
dark brown liquid.  The acidic odor that rises from it does offer some good
reasons for dieting... at least from this particular potion.

{...You feel a little weaker after drinking it.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I038
{...This yellowish-orange potion seems to vibrate on its own power, and a

at someone you love?
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I039
{...This dry, pinkish-white potion is charaterized by the light purple vapors
which rise from it and magically seem to form images from your past sexual
experiences.  Just as things are getting interesting though, a gust of wind
blows them away... ironicly.

A2I039A
{...This potion tastes alot like chalk dust.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I040
{...This dark grey potion seems to be dormant... no bubbles or noises come
from it at all.  For some unknown, author-implied reason this lonely liquid
fills you with sympathy -- after all, how must it feel being a plain, old
grey potion in a world of colorful and explosive elixirs and milkshakes.  You
have the urge to drink this one, just to make it feel wanted.

A2I040A
{...This lonely liquid appreciates your kindness in drinking it.  In return,
it grants your finger a special, magical power.

starts to fall out.

A2I042
{...This solid black potion is indeed a most intriguing liquid.  One whiff
of its spicy vapors and your mind is taken to an Oriental world of physical
strength and mental power shrouded in white mists.  Suddenly, out the white
mists a ninja (you assume) dressed in black, jumps at you yelling "Hai-yuh,
ahh-so!".  Hmmm, he seems a bit like an ahh-so himself, but you decide not
to mention that as he's swinging his body parts in your face.  Then as

chest...

Suddenly, you feel yourself transforming... long, blonde hair starts to grow
from your head (no, not THAT), and you feel a semi-holy radiance start to glow

don't know really who you are, but you suddenly have about 20 names running
through your head (oh, give it up already!)...

volleyball tournament.  It smells of sweat.

start to overcome you...

to keep your balance.  A sudden sarcastic attitude fills your mind, and you

infamous, at-large Sharibor the Destructor.
***
You have the sudden urge to bake nasty cookies.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I048
{...Ah, this yellowish-orange potion is truly a wonder to behold.  Every so
often, it will spout bluish-green streams of acid in the air, creating a
dazzling display of toxic waste.  However, its odor is enough to severly maim
a dinosaur.

Suddenly, your teeth begin to chatter and you feel you chest heaving with
great sexual energy...
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I050
{...This slimy, scuzy liquid from hell is truly the most disgusting mixture
of foul substances which you have ever beheld.  The odor it emits is strong
enough to fell a thousand men in armor, and Kyrannalussi knows what else!  In
its gooey depths, you see various green clumps of gunk floating around, and
every once and awhile it makes a high-pitched squeal at you screaming, "Help
me, I'm melting!!!!".

{...After you finish drinking this sourly delicious potion, you have the
sudden urge to aim your foot at someone.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I052
{...This sticky, brown potion emanates the strong smell of cotton candy,
which brings back childhood memories of... well, let's just say it can't be
printed.  Anyway, when you snap out of that momentary trance you notice that
the smell (or the memories?) have made you sick at your stomach.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I052A
{...You feel alot like Superman(woman) after drinking it...
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I053
{...This bright red potion has a rather distinctive demon claw protruding
from its opaque depths.  The claw reaches out for your nose, honks it six
times, waves, flips you the bird, and then vanishes into its liquidy home.

{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I054
{...This blonde-haired, blue-eyed potion was invented by Sharibor the
Destructor for personal enjoyment.  Or so legend has it.  However, you don't

sick of this emo-tion, ah-oh, just a lo-lo-lonely potion."  You have an
urge to throw this potion away.

} T Alchemy II Text

A2I057
{...This silverish potion is rather "heavy", in the sense that it weighs about
as much as a certain girl you remember from high school, the equivalent of a
two-ton block of cement.  It seems to have a similar personality as it just
sits and does nothing except spit up a few silver bubbles every so often.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I057A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I058
{...This light grey liquid has very few distinguishing traits.  Aside from its
color, it has no identifiable smell, consistency, or demo tape.  It would be
nice if it at least had a cute dress or a stand-up comic act, but no, no, this
is just one of those BORING potions.  It probably never got past third grade.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I058A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!

{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I060
{...This light brown potion has several large, white globs of marshmellow or
puss (you can't tell the difference by mere sight).  It has a very plesant,
perhaps deceivingly so, aroma, and you can feel the strong temptation to
drink it without so much as a thought.

A2I060A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I061
{...This gooey, black potion is quite reminiscent of the tar used in your old
town to set criminals on fire.  It brings back nice memories of barbecues with
your favorite burgalars and rapists.  Anyway, it has a pretty nasty odor, but
that's never stopped you before.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I061A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I062
{...This slightly yellowish liquid has the consistency and clarity of most
city water faucets... in other words, it's filled with every type of fungus

eye as you consider the thought of having to actually DRINK this.

A2I064
{...This sweet-smelling potion sets your senses on fire with one whiff of its
pugnant vapors.  It seems to change colors between green and blue, not really
sure which it likes better.  Suddenly, in a moment of daring, it changes to
bright orange, reminding you of Cyndi Laupers last hairstyle.  After a little
while, it changes back to blue.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I064A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I065
{...This shining, gold-tinted potion seems to be truly majestic unto its own
right.  In fact, it seems to act a bit condescending towards you, just a mere
mortal, while it is a potion of the Royal Family of Sewage.  You have the
sudden urge to drink this snobbish potion, but you hesitate out of respect
for your poor stomach.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I065A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I066
{...This bright blue potion reminds you of a certain dragon in its hue, and
its memory brings a small pang of sympathy to your heart.  Enraged, you yell
at the author, "Yo!  This was supposed to be a comedy!!  Get this drama out
of here this instant!".  Perhaps he was listening, because something starts
to water you from above.

A2I066A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!

A2I067A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I068

milk.  Strange potion.

A2I068A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I069
{...This bright green potion seems to sparkle with a particular light of its
own.  As you examine it closely, you hear an incredibly high-pitched wail
emanating from its depths, about three octaves above anything remotely human.
However, something about the sound comforts you with an almost magical
feeling, and you suddenly mumble something about the glory of love.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I069A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!

A2I070A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I071
{...This beautiful, blackish-brown potion simply amazes you with its wit.
It's wit?  Yes, it's wit.  As you examine this animated liquid, it barages
you with every imaginable sarcastic remark it can find against you.  You
cover your head with your hands, trying to protect yourself from its totally
unrelentless nagging comments.  It seems to turn a bit rose-colored during
all of this, which only infuriates it more.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I071A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I072
{...Like, totally mellow, man.  This potion knows how to relax, as its soft
brown liquid gently sloshes back and forth, holding you almost enchanted by
its magical music.  Rumors of the ancients mention that this was the favorite
drink of the temptress of innocent sheep herders herself, Lady Meling.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I072A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I073
{...Oh, no, not this!  A horrid mixture of blackened cherry, rotten grape,
sour orange, and petrified lemon/lime, this potion from hell almost attacks
you with its putrid odor.  You gasp for breath, realizing that this must be
diet cola... after smelling it, you don't think you can eat for at least a
week.

A2I073A
{...Mmmmmmm-mmmmm, delicious!!!!!

Something about it gives you an awesome feeling that you are very close to
solving the truths of your life.  Like, radical, dude.

A2I074A
{...Yes, this is the last potion... thank Kyrannalussi.  It tastes like the
sweat from your brow.

A2I075
{...Of distant relation to the lemonstone, this pale green rock looks pretty
worthless.  However, it does have a nice, smooth roundness to it.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I076
{...This bluish-white stone is quite soft to your touch, although pressing on
it provides unexpected resistance.  The smell of dirty bathwater pervades your
poor, innocent nostrils.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I077
{...This brown stone is quite rough with many interesting features and curves
to it... alot like Vanna White, although it has considerable less sexual
attractiveness to teenage males.

math teacher... except that at least he picked at his ear every so often,
something which the coal seems to refrain from doing.

A2I079
{...This beautiful piece of pink quartz sparkles brilliantly as you examine
it, almost hypnotizing you with its dancing array of myriad colors.  Cheap
bubblegum machine toy, or priceless jewel... YOU decide.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I080
{...Deep, dark, and green (reminiscent of your friend's left nostril), this
rather large emerald doesn't do much for your stomach.  However, something
about it seems almost "magical", strangely enough.  Either that, or too much
potion drinking on your part.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I081
{...This blue crystal is shaped in perfect likeness to a huge teardrop.  As
you examine it, a feeling of sympathy and compassion fills your soul.  For a
moment, for a just a teeny-weeny, brief, miniscule moment, you feel serious
about helping to alleviate the pain of the world.  Of course, a few seconds
later, you snap out of it.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I082
{...This tin lantern is a little bit rusty, but it still emits a rather bright
light from the hundreds of fireflies trapped within their metal prison and
hating every moment of it.  In fact, they seem to be considering rebellion,

it does.

{...He kicks you in the crotch.

when he speaks.  He waves his hand in your general direction and makes a rude
comment about "monkey"ing around.  He then gives you a sly wink.
} T Alchemy II Text
A2I087A
{...The Oracle giggles, but slips away.
} T Alchemy II Text

A2I088
{...The kyrapractor is indeed a beautful woman with long, blonde hair, bright,
shining eyes and long, pointy nails.  She smiles sweetly at you, reminding
you very much of the goddess Kyrannalussi.  You wonder about the similarity of
the names.

A2I088A
{...She slaps you.
} T Alchemy II Text

points to a sign.
