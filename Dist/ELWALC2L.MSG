{...You're %s outside the town entrance.  The red muck road leading
right up to the open gateway to the east looks well-worn by many thousands
of travellers.  The solid stone walls which seem to surround the town
are surprisingly high -- legend has it that they needed a special building
permit from Kyrannalussi.  The walls continue to the north and south into
the depths of the surrounding forest.  Carved into the stone above the
gateway are the words, "Welcome to Arykydal, Town of Good Ale".  The red
muck road winds off to the west.

{...You're %s outside the town entrance.  In the darkness of night
it is rather difficult to clearly see everything, but you notice a gateway
leading into the town to the east.  The high walls surrounding the town
continue into the forest to the north and south.  Something seems to be
carved into the stone above the gateway, but you can't quite make it out.
Unfortunately, you also notice that the gateway has been closed.  The road
you're currently on winds off to the west.

very large, and extremely large bartender -- with a name tag that reads, in
big (relatively) letters, "BARTENDER".  For some unexplainable reason you
assume he's the bartender.  He smiles at you, spits in a glass, rubs it with
his hands, burps, and says, "Ale costs 2 gold".  The main tavern room lies to

foolish thought is immediately banished as you notice the blood stains of the
previous performers.  A spotlight high above lights the stage perfectly, to
make sure the audience will see their targets.  The main tavern room lies to

place was originally used for the ancient orgies of Shakeabigwun.  However,
it was unfortunately converted to the dwelling of the local oracle after
Shakeabigwun and his cult were run out of town by a horde of machete-weilding
castrators -- but that is another story.  Sitting in a trance of meditation,
the oracle himself is before you in the center of this daboga.  Exits lie
in all directions.  You also take note of the symbol of a large shovel and
a pile of cow excrement hanging from the ceiling... the oracle's business

is where the mayor of the town used to make speeches -- until the Oracle got
tired of the "shovel comepetition" and ran him out of town.  Now, the other
