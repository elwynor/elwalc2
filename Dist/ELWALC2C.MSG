YOUWIN {

...Alright, I'll tell you... the ninth truth of life is...

To err is human, but to really foul things up requires a computer!

And to foul things up even more, I'm going to declare you as having solved
this game.  Congratulations, %s, and thanks for playing.  If you're
the first one to solve this on your system, your Sysop probably has a prize
for you, so why don't you go write him an E-MAIL message now using your
talented COMPUTER (he's my brother-in-law, actually).

Oh, by the way, that one human who gave me all these nasty ideas of gaming,
Scott Brinker, thanks you too...

YES, you've WON... now get outta here!!

and... sold by a very nice salesman.  My name is technical and complex to
pronounce, especially by a mere human such as yourself, so you can just call
